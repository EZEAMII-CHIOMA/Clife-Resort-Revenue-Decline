Clife Resort has been in hospitality business for years and have been experiencing decline in revenues and market shares and they want an insight on the issue.
The past 4 months data of the organization was avaialable for the Analysis, which is the month of April, May ,Jun,July.

Power Bi was used for the data analysis and data visualisation .

After the analysis ,I was able to find out that the organizations income was high in may but dropped by little percent in June but in July the decline was much.
The organization also experinced lots of customers cancelling their tickets after booking and makes the revenue generated to reduced too.
The rating by the customers also reduced and this affectes the Revenue realized by the company
